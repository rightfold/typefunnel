# TypeFunnel

TypeFunnel is a tool for extracting schemas and calls from sources. Examples of
sources are SQL queries, WSDL files, and static data. Schemas describe the
structure of data. From schemas, assets can be generated. Examples of such
assets are user interfaces, web services, serialization, and documentation.
Calls are procedures that fetch or modify data conforming to some schema. For
example, a call generated from a SQL query source will invoke the SQL query.
